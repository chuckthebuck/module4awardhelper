# Four Award Helper Module

Cron-backed Buckbot module for conservatively reviewing and processing [[Wikipedia:Four Award]] nominations on English Wikipedia.

This repository is intended to be loaded by the Buckbot module framework using `modules/four_award/module.toml`.

## Safety model

The module has per-action switches plus one emergency stop. To force a non-writing run, set:

```bash
FOUR_AWARD_DRY_RUN=1
```

Live action flags:

```bash
FOUR_AWARD_DRY_RUN=0
FOUR_AWARD_ENABLE_REPLIES=1
FOUR_AWARD_ENABLE_RECORDS=1
FOUR_AWARD_ENABLE_REMOVAL=1
FOUR_AWARD_ENABLE_TALK_NOTICES=1
FOUR_AWARD_ENABLE_ARTICLE_HISTORY=1
```

Recommended rollout:

1. Run dry-run only.
2. Enable nomination replies while keeping records/removal disabled.
3. Enable records after verifying table rebuilds.
4. Enable nomination removal, talk notices, and article-history updates last.

## Behavior

* Records table rows are rebuilt in canonical order: username A-Z, then award date/time.
* Each wikitable entry is emitted as a single line.
* The bot replies to nominations with hidden markers to avoid duplicate replies.
* Ambiguous judgment calls become `manual_review_needed`; the bot only approves with clear evidence and only fails on objective problems.
* Creation is checked against the article's first MediaWiki revision plus early article edits.
* DYK, GA, and FA credit is checked against process-page revisions/signatures and article edits during the relevant milestone windows.
* Automated approval is disabled unless `FOUR_AWARD_ALLOW_AUTOMATED_APPROVAL=1`.

## Development

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m py_compile modules/four_award/*.py
PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest -q
```

## Historic replay tests

Replay cases compare the bot's in-memory edits against known after-revisions, without saving to Wikipedia:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m modules.four_award.replay tests/fixtures/four_award_replay_case.example.json
```

Use `before_revid` and `expected_revid` for each page touched by an old review diff. Add `page_creation` and `revision_users` evidence so the reviewer can reproduce the old approval/failure decision deterministically.
